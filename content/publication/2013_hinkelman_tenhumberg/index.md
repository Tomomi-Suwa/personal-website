abstract: "Generalist predator guilds play a prominent role in structuring insect communities and can contribute to limiting population sizes of insect pest species. A consequence of dietary breadth, particularly in predatory insects, is the inclusion of low-quality, or even toxic, prey items in the predator’s diet. Consumption of low-quality prey items reduces growth, development, and survival of predator larvae, thereby reducing the population sizes of generalist predators. The objective of this paper was to examine the effect of a suspected low-quality aphid species, *Aphis fabae* (Scopoli) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), on the larval performance of an abundant North American predator, *Hippodamia convergens* (Guérin-Méneville) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). For comparison, *H. convergens* larvae were also reared on a known high-quality aphid species *Acyrthosiphon pisum* (Harris) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and on a 50:50 mix of both aphid species. The proportion of *H. convergens* larvae surviving to the adult stage was dramatically lower (0.13) on the *A. fabae* diet than on the *A. pisum* diet (0.70); survival on the mixed diet was intermediate (0.45) to survival on the single-species diets. Similarly, surviving *H. convergens* larvae also de-veloped more slowly and weighed less as adults on the *A. fabae* diet than on the *A. pisum* diet. Despite the relatively poor performance on the *A. fabae* diet, *H. convergens* larvae killed large numbers of *A. fabae*. Furthermore, *H. convergens* displayed a preference for *A. fabae* in the mixed diet treatment, most likely because *A. fabae* was easier to catch than *A. pisum*. The results suggest that increases in the distribution and abundance of *A. fabae* in North America may have negative effects on *H. convergens* population size."
